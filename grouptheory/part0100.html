<p>Starting to explain the abstract ideas is always difficult. Since it is hard to pinpoint a single approach or a viewpoint that captures the whole idea of the subject, carrying the first words is challenging. Among these difficult and abstract theories, there lies the group theory.</p>
<p>From what I’ve seen in group theories’ textbooks, books, or lectures, there are usually two different approaches to it. People either start with an easy group theory example, usually talking about symmetries and other similar stuffs (stuffs like Rubik’s cube symmetry group), or they start off by simply stating the axioms that defines groups. In here, we’re going to do the second one, because I believe the second approach is a lot more straight-forward and is actually much easier to follow.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-group-theory" class="unnumbered"> What is a Group Theory? </h2>
<p>Group theory is a theory that studies a special creature in mathematics called <strong>Group</strong>. But what is a group you might say? Group is actually a combination of a set and an operation, with some special rules governing them. These rules are the definition of groups and they are usually called the <strong>axioms</strong> of group. Let’s take a look at these axioms:</p>
<div class="formula">
<p><span class="math display">\[(G, \circ ) \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
\circ : G \times G \to G\]</span></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Identity member: <span class="math display">\[\exists e  \in G : \forall g \in G: eg=ge=g \label{eq:1}\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>Inverse member: <span class="math display">\[\forall g \in G: \exists g^{-1} \to g g^{-1} = g^{-1} g = e \label{eq:2}\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>Associativity: <span class="math display">\[\forall g,h,l \in G: g \circ (h \circ l) = (g \circ h ) \circ l \label{eq:3}\]</span></p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<h2 id="so-what-does-it-say" class="unnumbered">So what does it say? </h2>
<p>Let’s dig in and see what these axioms say. If we have a set <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, and an operation <span class="math inline">\(\circ\)</span>, we note our group like <span class="math inline">\((G,\circ)\)</span>. This set and this operation can be any arbitrary set or operation, as long as they satisfy the equations <a href="#eq:1" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eq:1">[eq:1]</a> to <a href="#eq:3" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eq:3">[eq:3]</a>.</p>
<p>So let’s go through them one by one. What do these actually mean? And why after all, these three specific and <em>strange</em> rules? Let’s talk about that.<br />
First of all, you can see that before our axiom number 1, we have <span class="math inline">\((G, \circ ) \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
\circ : G \times G \to G\)</span>. This little rules, that we didn’t put a number on, is actually stating that the set <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> should be closed under <span class="math inline">\(\circ\)</span>. Some people count this so called <em>closure</em> property as the first axiom of a group, thus they have 4 axioms in total. Here, we didn’t count it as one of the main axioms, but a beforehand assumption. This closure property is actually very important, and it means that for every <span class="math inline">\(a,b\)</span> as members of our set <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(a \circ b\)</span> is also inside our <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>. This property helps us a lot, and is very necessary, since it makes groups some independent creatures that are closed within themselves.</p>

<p>Imagine you have a set <span class="math inline">\(G=\{1,-1\}\)</span> and an operation of common <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(1 \times 1 = 1 \in G\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(1 \times -1 = -1 \in G\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(-1 \times 1 = -1 \in G\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(-1 \times -1 = 1 \in G\)</span>, the set <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is closed under <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span>. First step is checked.</p>
<p>So let’s go for the first axiom. All it says is: There should be a single member <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> in our set <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, that when it is combined with any other member <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, whether from left or right, it returns <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> itself. This <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> is called identity member. This identity is something that looks like number 1 for common <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span>. Or maybe 0 for common <span class="math inline">\(+\)</span>. It’s somehow the neutral member of our group. From now on we are going call this identity member <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> for all of our groups, unless it is mentioned otherwise.</p>
<p>The second axiom uses this identity member <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span>, in a relation between other members. So what does the second axiom states? It says that for any member, there should be an inverse member. But what is exactly defined as an inverse member? An inverse of <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is noted like <span class="math inline">\(g^{-1}\)</span>, and when it is acted with operation <span class="math inline">\(\circ\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> from any side, it should return the identity member <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span>. These notations are pretty much like the common notations of th same old multiplication <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span>, but be very careful that in here we are talking about the general operation of <span class="math inline">\(\circ\)</span> which could be <span class="math inline">\(\times, +\)</span>, or any other different or even strange operations. But anyhow, we still use notations similar to the common <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span>, because it is familiar to our eyes.</p>
<p>So until now group is <span class="math inline">\((G,\circ)\)</span>, which our set G looks something like this:</p>
<div class="formula">
<p><span class="math display">\[G= \{ \cdots , g_3^{-1} , g_2^{-1} , g_1^{-1} , e , g_1 , g_2 , g_3 , \cdots \}\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>Note that we have <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> as an identity member, and for every member of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, we have its’ inverse. Also note that inverse of the inverse of a member is the member itself <span class="math inline">\((g_1^{-1})^{-1}=g\)</span> (this is pretty easy to prove). What about inverse of <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span>? well inverse of <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> itself, since <span class="math inline">\(e \circ e = e \circ e = e\)</span>. We also assumed that <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is closed under <span class="math inline">\(\circ\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now onto the third axiom. Associativity. This third one seems a little strange and out of place, but believe me, it is a very important characteristic of our operation <span class="math inline">\(\circ\)</span>. You have surely heard of associativity before, and all it says is that the order of operation <span class="math inline">\(\circ\)</span> should not matter. Either you do <span class="math inline">\(\circ\)</span> on the first two first, and then on the third, or you do it on the second and the third one first, then on the first one, this should not produce a different result. This is actually a very important rule in group theory. Its’ importance is not obvious in here, but you will see that almost every time we are proving something, we are using this property. Without it, this theory and its’ Theorems are unprovable.</p>

<p>Before we go on, I should mention that the order of <span class="math inline">\(\circ\)</span> matters in general. so <span class="math inline">\(a \circ b \neq b \circ a\)</span>. We didn’t assume anything regarding this matter. But if <span class="math inline">\(a \circ b = b \circ a\)</span> is true in a group for any <span class="math inline">\(a,b \in G\)</span>, We call that group an <strong>Abelian</strong> group. So an Abelian group is a group which its’ members order in an operation is commutable.</p>
<p>So that’s it. You now know what a group is. In summary, <strong>Group</strong> is a set and an operation, usually denoted like <span class="math inline">\((G,\circ)\)</span>, which G is <strong>Closed</strong> under <span class="math inline">\(\circ\)</span>, has an <strong>Identity</strong> member <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span>, for any of its’ members has an <strong>Inverse</strong> member, and the operation <span class="math inline">\(\circ\)</span> is <strong>Associative</strong> for all members of our set <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>. Remember and memorize these four characteristics of a group since from these, rises everything else.</p>
<h2 id="but-why-these-specific-set-of-rules" class="unnumbered">But Why These Specific Set Of Rules?</h2>
<p>Well, this is not very easy to answer. Historically speaking, many ages ago in the ancient Greece, people were very much interested in geometry, as a main subject of mathematics and logic that they cherished much. People started proposing theorems and proving them from many places. Almost all of these theorems and facts about the geometrical world, were somehow dependent on the other theorems. After a while that the number of these theorems was increased, a concern were risen. What if all of these theorems are connected to each-other in a circular reasoning. This means that if we put all of our reasonings together it will become something like these: A is true because B is true. And B is true because C is true. But why is C true? because A is true. You can see that this is actually a logical fallacy.</p>
<p>So Euclid came to the rescue. He said to avoid this or any other fallacy, we should assume some axioms to be true, and from there, make our way up to prove everything else. Now just assuming something to be true is a little bit out of the spirits of mathematics, so he wanted the list of these postulates to be as short as possible. After-all, he came out with the famous 5 euclidean geometry axioms that we still use today.</p>
<p>Now this method and idea was used again many years after Euclid, in the field of algebra. Algebra was at first, probably mainly developed for its’ applications in trading, taxing, and daily applications. It was not formed based on any axioms, and like the world of geometry before Euclid, there was a huge number of theorems, any of them from a different era and different people, and all of them depending on each other. Many years later mathematicians started axiomatic study of algebra. What was the least amount of axioms required to develop the whole algebra we know?</p>

<p>Now this is a very huge topics and we are not going to talk about that here. People came out with many postulates as axioms, like the rule of associativity that we’ve already discussed. A great deal of modern algebra is developed because of these endeavors. You’ve probably heard of basic algebra axioms, for the common operations of <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(+\)</span>. Now these studies became very important at the dawn of the modern mathematics. Mathematicians started assuming different axioms for their algebraic structure and check what will come out of them. They’ve played with these rules, added or removed some of them and tried to modify these axioms or definitions. People started asking questions like: Okay, what if I had a algebraic system without associativity? And there it came <em>Non-Associative Algebras</em>. Many ideas and phenomena were developed like <strong>Fields</strong> and <strong>Rings</strong>. For example, a field is a set with two operations defined on it, usually denoted as <span class="math inline">\(+\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\cdot\)</span>, with six axioms or definitions pretty similar to the axioms that we had for our groups. For these fields, if the set be <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>, and we select the two operations to be the common summations and multiplication, we would have a field, and the common algebra that we’ve learned in high school. So you can see that these ideas are generalizations of the common algebra. A generalizations to any arbitrary set and any arbitrary operations, that they all act the same way.</p>
<p>Some group theory books tend to talk about Fields or Rings, before mentioning the definitions of group, but we are not going to cover them here. Anyway, if you are interested to know them, you can search and check them up, before continuing reading this.</p>
<p>The first mentioning of something named group was done by Evariste Galois in 1830s to the study polynomial equations. Galois tried to find a definitive solution to the fifth order of general polynomial equations, and in his papers he described a algebraic system for his proof. Years later this system was polished, with nice and definite axioms (Which we’ve just learned), under the name of <em>group</em>. After that people realized that this algebraic system has lot’s and lot’s of applications, and we can actually see and form systems that behave in these four simple characteristics, over many different fields. Hence the group theory was developed and grew. And more than a hundred years later, it’s still one of the hot topics of mathematics.</p>

<p>I’ve told all of this history just to create a general idea that why these certain axioms were formed and why they matter. My attempt certainly didn’t answer the main question directly, and I have to say the answer to that question is a little bit hard. But I hope with this general picture and history behind group theory made everything a little bit more clear, and I hope you find the subject more appealing. The more that you learn about group theory, the more you are going to get closer to the answers of these basic questions, and you’re going to appreciate group theories’ simplicity and its’ vast applications. And it is interesting that sometimes, to answer the very basic and simple questions, ironically, you require lot’s of knowledge and experience. So with all of these questions at the back of our head, let’s dig in and hope to find our answers in our way.</p>
<p>I think this is enough for an introduction. In the next part we are going to cover some examples of groups, and check if these four characteristics that we’ve talked about are true about them or not.</p>
